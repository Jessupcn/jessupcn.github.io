          I'm Connor Jessup, a Software Engineer currently located in the New
          York City area. After graduating from the University of Michigan with
          a B.S. in Environmental Studies and DePaul University with a M.S. in
          Management, I worked at a small manufacturing company (Jessup
          Engineering Inc.) that my grandfather founded for 2 years. I
          ultimately decided to pursue my passion and transition into Software
          Engineering, and attended Fullstack Academy of Code from January
          through May 2018. Since then, I have been working on various personal
          projects to develop my coding further as well as studying algorithms
          and data structures!
